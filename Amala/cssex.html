There is a git controlled folder on a server where the main branch is checked out and a whole pile of files have been modified and not committed. Is there a way for me to commit the changes to a separate branch so I can go back to a clean version?

ie I want to effecitvely undo all this persons changes but store them in another chance so if that person wants their changes they can switch to that branch.

(Yes I know this is not how git is designed to work but that is my situation!) Any ideas very much
